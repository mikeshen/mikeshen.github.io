Mike Shen is a software engineer with a breadth of experience in technology and financial markets.

I am passionate about developing a deep understanding of the financial markets using data analysis, financial modeling, and robust/real-time software systems. I focus on iterating using rapid ingestion and actionization of new data.

I also enjoy diving into the evolution of the software development toolchain with the rise of low/no code development and the power of AI-assisted software development. I believe these technologies have the power to radically disrupt the existing industry and will result in order-of-magnitude increases in both efficiency and safety of software.

In my freetime, I enjoy:
- chats over coffee. Let me know if you're ever in NYC and want to pick my brain.
- studying financial markets and dabbling in global macro trading.
- travel - 19 countries and counting.
- piano.
- basketball.
- running.
- biking or scootering around Manhattan.
- hanging with, petting and serving my two cats.
