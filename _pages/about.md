## A software engineer with a breadth of experience in technology and financial markets.

I am passionate about developing a deep understanding of the financial markets using data analysis, financial modeling, and robust/real-time software systems. I focus on iterating using rapid ingestion and actionization of new data.

I also enjoy diving into the evolution of software development toolchains. The rise of low/no code development and AI-assisted development has the power to radically disrupt the existing industry and will result in order-of-magnitude increases in both efficiency and safety of software.

In my free time, I enjoy:

- Having chats over coffee. Let me know if you're ever in NYC and want to pick my brain.
- Studying financial markets and dabbling in global macro trading.
- Dabling in prediction markets. Currently on Polymarket, previously PredictIt.
- Exploring generative AI.
- Traveling - I've been to 28 countries and counting. Check out my [map](https://mikeshen.github.io/images/MapChart_Map.png).
- Reading.
- Making smoothies.
- Design and architecture.
- Playing the piano.
- Cooking.
- Playing basketball.
- Bouldering.
- Running.
- Practicing yoga.
- Watching Michigan football.
- Playing board games. Some of my favorites include Catan, Codenames, Terraforming Mars, and Monikers.
- Biking or scootering around Manhattan.
- Hanging out with, petting, and serving my two cats.
